WARNING
-
this code is just a MVP and completely untouched since November 2017. So it is deprecated, dangerous and ugly. It contains hardcoded stuff, mixed English and Finnish language, missing features and bugs.

Background:
- 
In Business Information Systems studies in Jyväskylä University of Applied Sciences, there is a software development course in second year named Ticorporate, which simulates a real software corporation and lasts the whole year. In Ticorporate students create their own app or game in small teams using agile scrum.

In 2017 fall I was in a team, whose project was a small product management app for different stores and restaurants. Front end was made with Ionic, and back end was done with Angular and MongoDB. My task was to create an MVP admin page with Angular. Because I did not have any earlier experience with Angular, the beginning of fall (Sep-Oct) I was learning to use Angular, and this code was done mainly in the beginning of November. Since it was decided not to continue the developing of the app, and I was on this course only the fall season, this code is completely untouched since then. Therefore, it is deprecated, dangerous and ugly. But it is still my first real touch with Angular.

Missing features:
- 
* feedback when adding new product or category to database has succeeded/unsucceeded
* editing of existing categories and products
* list view of existing things
* deletion of product or category
* authentication
